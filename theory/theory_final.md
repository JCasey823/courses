# Theory of Computation Final

For the final project you will give a 10-15 minute presentation on an advanced topic in complexity or computability theory. This may be an advanced topic from the textbook or a research paper.  You may work with up to two partners, but in this case, each person is expected to contribute roughly equally in the presentation.  

You may use PowerPoint and/or the chalkboard for your presentation.  If you use the chalkboard, you must submit to me your notes.

Your presentation will be graded based on clarity, organization, and completeness.  Hastily assembled presentations will recieve a low grade.  Be sure to **provide context** for your presentation.  Do not assume that everyone knows what you know from studying your topic.  Make it **understandable** for someone with a reasonable knowledge of Theory of Computing (the entire class).  

You likely won't understand everything in your paper or topic, but you are being tested on your ability to glean as much information as you can (from whatever sources you can find) to understand the topic well enough to explain the fundamentals to someone else.  You're also being tested on your ability to present.



The following are some potential papers with results or ideas that you might consider presenting.  If none of these interest you, the later chapters in the textbook, the [Complexity Zoo](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo), or the [Computational Complexity blog](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org) may be of interest.  The philosophically minded may find some inspiration [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec) and [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing/).

**Your top five choices, and any group members, should be submitted to Canvas by the deadline.**

## Grading:

A: A polished presentation that provides sufficient detail and background of the topic being presented, including the relevant citations to relevant work.  Provides context to the problem and why it is interesting and/or important.  Uses and explains formulas where appropriate without attempting to obfuscate.

B: Good presentation with some rough edges.  May have some grammatical and/or spelling errors.  Generally good coverage of topic but lacks detail and/or context.

C: Presentation which attempts to address the topic, but may have mistakes and/or may be missing key details.  Is either too short or unfinished due to lack of time.  Has mistakes that show lack of basic understanding of the topic.

D: Clearly rushed presentation with little detail or lazy presentation.
