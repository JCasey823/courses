# Homework 1: Voice User Interface



You will use automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) to create a program completely navigable by voice. Your program should not rely on text or mouse input or output to function. It should adhere to the design principles we have discussed in class. You have been provided with example [Python 3 code](https://github.com/acgrissom/courses/tree/master/2020-hci/code) using the pyttx and SpeechRecognizer APIs.  The SpeechRecognizer API can use a Google-powered ASR engine through the Internet or an offline engine called PocketSphinx.  For the latter, PocketSphinx must be installed separately.  The Google engine does not require any extra setup, though you should be mindful of its limitations when testing your project. (See: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas)

You may use other languages/APIs if you like, but these were chosen because they are simple to use and reasonably cross-platform. If you prefer, you may convert an existing open source program into one that uses a voice user interface, such as a [port](https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/) of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Your project must be approved.

Write a short (~1 pg) report, in Markdown or LaTeX, describing your project and both the challenges and the rationale for your HCI decisions. How did you design signifiers and affordances? What kind of conceptual model are you conveying? What kind of feedback do you need? How did you modify your program to take into account feedback? Was timing an issue? Is security difficult with a voice UI?

You will demonstrate your projects in class after the due date.



* Design document/report(25 points)

  * Describes design decisions (e.g., with a flowchart) (5 ts)

  * Describe rationale for design decisions, limitations, advantages (5 pts)

  * Contrasts with alternative UIs (e.g., using text-based or graphical input). (5 pts)

  * Report describe possible improvements (5 pts)

  * Report is formatted well, reasonably grammatical, organized into appropriate sections (5pts)

    

* Programs runs correctly without crashing. (25 points)

* Affordances conveyed. It must be clear how to interact with the program. (10pts)

* User can navigate and exit the program without text I/O. (10pts)

* Program provides feedback. (10pts)

* Program is enjoyable to use (doesn’t become unusable if something goes wrong, provides appropriate timing). Program handle misunderstood inputs and errors elegantly. (10pts)

* Provides personalization and security (e.g., remembers preferred name, login password) (10pts)

## Project Suggestions

* Zork-like game.  Instead of typing commands and reading them, the user speaks command and the computer replies.
* Computer file manager/navigator: for an example, see: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-simple-voice-assistant-for-your-mac-in-python-62247543b626
* Calendar (Add, remove, change events)
* Address Book
* Others (must be approved)
* Text editor/dictation app, with the ability to edit, delete, etc.
* Write computer programs with voice

## Setup Instructions to Run Code:

1. For macOS:

   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select --install
   brew install portaudio
   ```

   For Linux:
   See https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ for troubleshooting.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
   
   ```

   For Windows:

   Download and PyAudio for your platform from here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

   Assuming you're using 64-bit Python 3.7,in the same directory containing the wheel, run:

   ```bash
   pip3 install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl
   ```

2. On all platforms

   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade pip
   pip3 install pyttsx3
   pip3 install speechrecognition
   pip3 install pocketsphinx (optional)
   ```

   You may need to use `pip` instead of `pip3` or `--user` if you do not have elevated privileges.
