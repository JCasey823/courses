Office Hours: Tuesday, Thursday 11:45-12:45, 4:25-5:00, and by appointment

# Syllabus

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a broad, interdisciplinary field spanning psychology, ethics, public policy, and several other fields.  Unlike many other computer science classes, which focus mostly on implementation, the majority of this course takes a broader, human-centered view of technology and develops the vocabulary and analytical tools to understand, evaluate, and create technology with which humans must interact.

In addition to providing a standard introduction introduction to human-computer (HCI), covering its history, theory, research methods, and practice, students will gain hands-on experience designing and implementing systems that require careful design.  We will also interrogate recent trends in the evolution of  the relationship between humans and computers, including the prevalance of surveillance systems and addictive technologies, by critically reading and discussing both material used by practitioners and theoretical work critiquing these approaches. 

This course has substantial writing and discussion components, whereby students critically analyze user HCI paradigms and human interaction with designed objects in the real world.  Students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss these topics. There will be a significant project component that requires students to undertake either a small HCI research study or build a non-traditional user interface.  In addition, each student must sign up to lead discussions on book chapters from Zuboff's *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,* which we will read and discuss throughout the semester.  By engaging with this influential work, students will follow and evaluate and long, complex argument over the course of the semester.  We will also *critically* read the popular Eyal's *Hooked: How to Build Habit-forming Products,* a popular guide used by professionals for designing "habit-forming" applications, directly engaging with current paradigms driving user interaction.  We will read these texts in conversation with the fundmental theory and vocabulary of HCI and with current events.

**Materials**

The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*, by Shoshana Zuboff

*Hooked: How to Build Habit-forming Products, by Nir Eyal*

*Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective, by I. Scott MacKenzie (Optional)*

**Objectives**

Students will be conversant of HCI principles and able to apply them in practical settings.

Students will have completed a substantial research study or project that requires the application of HCI principles and/or methodology.

Students will be familiar with the current state-of-the art in HCI principles.

Students will learn to read HCI research papers.

Students will gain experience using modern human-computer interfaces, such as voice interfaces, touch screens, and smart watches.

Students will interrogate the ethics and social implications of emerging technologies and how they affect human behavior.

**Prerequisites**

Students should be able to write code in a high-level programming language, such as C++, Python, or Java.

This course assumes access to a Unix (OS X, Linux, etc.) environment. The Windows Subsystem for Linux is sufficient for this purpose.



**Approach**

"It doesn't matter what we cover; it matters what you discover."

-Victor Weisskoph



From the first day of class, students should think about what they would like to do for their final project. This will evolve over the course of the semester.

Classes vary between lectures, in-class exercises, and discussions. Assignments vary between short homework assignments, longer programming assignments, practical machine learning experiments, and, occasionally, essays. Students may be expected to watch a lecture prior to class.

It is required that students have regular access to a computer and an Internet connection throughout this course. If you have a laptop, it will sometimes be useful to bring it to class.



**Homework**

Every week, there will be homework assignments designed to mentally solidify concepts from the course. In addition, every week there will be in-class surveys regarding the material.



**Weekly Writing Assignments**

Every week, students are expected to submit analytical reflections incorporating at least one of the readings for the week.



**Midterm**

This course will have one midterm that covers fundamental HCI concepts.

Expected legitimate absences for the midterm must be approved by me at least two weeks in advance.







**Final Exam**

Attendance for the final presentation is mandatory. If you expect to have a legitimate absence, it is your responsibility to inform me at least a month beforehand.

The final exam in this course consists of a written report and presentation of a course-long project, wherein students design, implement, and analyze a machine learning experiment from scratch, using publicly available data. Progress reports will occur throughout the semester to ensure that students are making adequate progress. The presentations will occur on the final exam date. The papers will be due 24 hours prior to the presentation.



**Class Participation**

Students are expected to come to class having read the material assigned. 

Students are also encouraged to ask questions of the instructor and of other students on the class message board.

If a class has an assigned video, students are expected to approach it as a class reading, watching it prior to class, and come prepared with questions.

Students are encouraged to post interesting articles relevant to HCI on the message board.

Students should come prepared for discussions by having read the material.

Students should always be respectful toward other students.

At the start of class, students are encouraged to bring up interesting things they have read or heard about in HCI. Interested students may wish to give a brief talk or presentation for extra credit. Interested students should ask the professor about this.







**Assignment Submission**

The report for the course project must be submitted in LaTeX (with a PDF), using the SIGCHI template.

Programming assignment reports must be submitted in LaTeX (with a PDF) using the SIGCHI template.

Regular homework assignments should be submitted as a single Markdown file or as a zipped LaTeX file (with a PDF).



**Late Policy**

Late penalties are as follows:

1 day: Maximum possible grade reduced by 15%

2 days: Maximum possible grade reduced by 30%

3 days: Maximum possible grade reduced by 50%

No assignments will be accepted more than three days after the due date.



**Attendance**

Attendance is mandatory, and attendance will be taken. More than five unexcused absences may result in being dropped from the class and/or receiving an F for the class. Coming in after we have begun counts half of an absence. If you expect to have a string of legitimate absences or late arrivals -- or if you have a class across campus -- it is your responsibility to let me know at at least two weeks beforehand. As stated above, if you expect to have a legitimate reason for missing an exam, you must let me know at least two weeks beforehand. Otherwise, you will receive no credit.





**Class Cancellation Policy:**

Class will be cancelled if the college calls an Inclement Weather Day. The hotline is 610.409.3700 and KYW (AM 1060); the closing number is 429. Should class be cancelled for this or any other reason, I will contact the class via e-mail and/or Canvas. Assignment due dates are unaffected by weather.

Very rarely, the professor may need to reschedule class due to professional travel. Students will be given advance notice in such cases.



**Grading**

- Components of the final grade are as follows:
- Class Discussions 20%
- Homework Assignments 20%
- Midterm 15%
- Quizzes 10%
- Weekly Writing Assignments 15%
- Final Project 30%

There will be no dropped grades.





**Troubleshooting
** When asking the professor for help debugging, students must provide the following:

- Information about the environment (OS version, compiler/interpreter version, etc.)
- Error output.
- Other conditions under which the error is or is not reproduced.
- Evidence that the student has attempted to solve the problem.





**Class Etiquette**

Excessively texting, sleeping, using social networks, or otherwise being disruptive in class may affect your participation grade (and, more importantly, your ability to follow along).



**Accommodations**

Ursinus College is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. Students with a disability should contact Anne Aikens ([aaikens@ursinus.edu](mailto:aaikens@ursinus.edu), 484-762-4329) as soon as possible to discuss academic accommodations and/or services. Anne Aikens is located in the Center for Academic Support, lower level of Myrin Library. Also see https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-academic-support/students-with-disabilities/

It is your responsibility to notify me if you receive accommodations for assigned work.



**Academic Warnings**

In accordance with the Collegeâ€™s policy, I will send out Academic Warnings for poor grades on assignments, excessive absences, or other reasons.
